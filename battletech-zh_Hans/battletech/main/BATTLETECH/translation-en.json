Born on the street, raised on the street, and coping however he could, he found something that brings him an inner glow and personal balance.

She started out by participating in local talent shows, where she repeatedly won Miss Congeniality, but didn't quite catch on with the local population of farmers and biologists. But after watching the 'Mech dance routine teenage Amanda put together, a supportive great-aunt scraped together the funds to take herself and her young charge off to Solaris VII.  There Amanda trialed at several gladiatorial stables before her savvy great-aunt provoked a small bidding war between the stables to get Amanda one of the most excellent rookie contracts in recent history. It was an uncommon move, but Amanda Ahn was an uncommon find even in gladiatorial circles, and she went over big from the beginning. An absolute natural in the cockpit, she was a popular sensation due to her skills, style, optimism, and scrappiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was living her dream, and she loved it, all the way until her great-aunt died. Her new agent, while good at the business end of things, didn't have Amanda's great-aunt's sense of how to protect Amanda's temperament from some of the darker elements of the Solaris VII gladiatorial world.  As Amanda coped with the loss of a most beloved mentor, she was still expected to be her famously cheerful self. She couldn't do it alone, and turned to stimulants and alcohol for help. Eventually, as it did with so many gladiators, it backfired on her. Caught up in a hideous scandal, Amanda was advised by her new agent to leave Solaris VII for a few years so the scandal could be forgotten.

It was a move designed to save the lives of Kell's unit, and it succeeded; Kurita was unable to kill Kell, and the duel ended in a stalemate. Afterward, Kell disbanded the majority of the Kell Hounds, put the remainder under the control of his brother Patrick, and retired to a life of self-imposed exile at the St. Marinus House monastery on Zaniah.

She spent part of her childhood in a group home before being fostered with a family of small business owners and philanthropists. They saw that she received a good education, and after, that she had a place in their enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, although she tried very hard to impress her benefactors, she was incurably honest. Not just honest, but <i>truthful</i>, in a way that embarrassed even customers of the business. Her family-turned-employers took her off the sales floor. <i>Nobody</i> wanted her on the admin level, so they sent her back to school for an advanced degree. They intended, eventually, to put her in an advisory position, but their kind intentions were derailed by happenstance. One day, while she was on a field trip, her convoy was attacked by one mercenary company, and rescued by another. During the battle, Anja found herself in a pilotless 'Mech and discovered that the same trait that made her unable to resist describing the problems with products also gave her a keen eye for picking out the perfect shots from a 'Mech cockpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, it wasn't what her foster family wanted for their Anja, but they were too much the businesswomen to let an opportunity like that skate by. Soon Anja was working regularly as a convoy guard, which only lasted until she got bored enough to transfer to a mercenary company. Because, as she told her family, if she was going to sit in a 'Mech all day, she at least wanted to see new places. She promised she'd write them. Her letters have all sorts of interesting details, and they always know that if she says she's all right, she's doing just fine.",

Instead, he enlisted in the AFFS as soon as he was of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after his enlistment, his record was blanked. His family lost contact with him, except for the occasional update from his superior offices reassuring them he was still alive.

They treated him well, but while his skills were adequate to keep him alive, he didn't have the personality to shine. After several years, his manager advised him to give up on Solaris while he still could. He was advised to head out to the Periphery where he would do well as a mercenary. His manager even provided him with a list of companies to try to join, and a letter of recommendation that spoke highly of his even temperament and marksman skills.",

It wasn't so much that life was hard on the farm, but that nothing he did there would ever really matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n When he was old enough, he enrolled in a local tech school, specializing in military equipment, because maintaining tractors and maintaining tanks wasn't that different.  'Mechs were more challenging, but the principles were the same, and repairing 'Mechs was his ticket off the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe signed on with a small mercenary company as a tech, but took advantage of the informal setting and his personal relationship with the commander to get some cockpit time. When one too many of the regular pilots was benched, he had his opportunity to show what he could do as a pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the status quo returned, he knew he couldn't return to being just a MechTech. He said a fond farewell to the company that had lifted him to the stars and set out on a career as a freelance agent. He drifted from temporary company to temporary company, looking for someplace where he'd fit as well as he did in his first company -- and still be able to pilot a 'Mech of his own.",

He was raised on Hachiman in the Draconis Combine, the child of IT executives, and he got an early start dabbling in the digital world. He was a rising star at the technology academy he attended, until certain of his extracurricular activities related to an illegal information brokerage came to light. While nothing was ever proven against him, he left the academy under a cloud of suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing his skills, he managed to hide his dubious record and get a job at Victory Industries, where he worked hard to keep his record clean. If information on a salvage breakthrough leaked, well, there was no evidence it was his fault. Except that record he'd cleaned up came to the attention to the Internal Security Force, who considered that evidence enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Daksis had to forge a new identity for himself, and this time, he had to burn through quite a few connections just to survive. Once he made it to the Periphery, the pressure eased and he was able to relax a little once again. He decided, for his own health, that he ought to retire from information brokering. So now he's working as a mercenary, because, he says, it keeps him out of worse trouble.",

In primary school, she learned a number of safety routines, but the only ones that really mattered were the Fusion Accident drill and the Raiders drill. In her teens, she spent time developing an improved drill so that kids would have a better chance of surviving either eventuality, but nobody wanted to change what hadn't yet failed and all she accomplished was losing her chance at a scholarship. So, as soon as she could she enlisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Alliance Grenadiers, she kept her head down for a while, pushing herself to be the toughest of the tough while learning all the protocols of her regiment. After a few years she once again felt like she'd identified some easily repairable flaws in the military machine, and cautiously, to a trusted superior, she made some suggestions. Once again, her suggestions were rejected, but this time she was transferred to the unnumbered 'shadow battalion' of the Grenadiers, where her superior promised her analysis skills would be appreciated. They were. She spent five satisfying years developing strategies for dealing with the ever-evolving pirate threat to Praxton, until internal politics she hadn't anticipated dissolved the shadow battalion and discharged most of its staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, she's been a wanderer. At first, she lived as a tourist, getting to know more of the Periphery, but eventually, as funds ran out and her contacts dried up, she found herself signing onto a mercenary company as a MechWarrior.  It isn't a career, but as she learns more about mercenary companies, she's realized that perhaps it's a stepping stone to one.",

The youngest son of a teacher and a Circinus dropship captain, from his earliest days he was an explorer. Before he was ten, he was camping alone in the wilderness near his small town, and taking apart household appliances to see how they worked. Yes, he got lost; yes, sometimes the appliances never worked again. The important thing was that now he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn secondary school, he wondered what would happen if he started an AgroMech racing league. He found out (and was suspended). He wondered what would happen if he provoked others who quailed at challenges. He found out (and came in third instead of first). After he graduated, having thoroughly explored his small town and the local spaceport, he headed to Circinus. Based on his father's wary endorsement, he was accepted into the Black Warriors as a MechTech. He then promptly wondered what would happen if a MechTech went along on a raid. He found out (and got to pose as ground crew to steal a 'Mech.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHis commanding officer appreciated his fearless willingness to stick his nose into anything\\u2026 most of the time. He brought 'Mechs home to Circinus without any interest in keeping them, which made up for the trouble he got into. But one day he stumbled into his commander's personal life. That abruptly ended his career with the Black Warriors, and he left the Circinus Federation with a bounty on his head and an enthusiastic interest in seeing the rest of the universe. Now he gets by taking what mercenary work he can, especially work that lets him see new things.",

The son of working class parents in the Duchy of Oriente while it was still part of the Free Worlds League, he grew up knowing the value of hard, skilled work. He earned excellent marks in his primary schooling, and his references all commented on his maturity and responsibility. Despite this, he was refused entrance to the Princefield Military Academy. His family, his planet, his entire Duchy lacked the status to compel Princefield to accept him. Hard work was valuable, but not to the elite.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn retaliation, he anonymously drew caricatures of many of the figures associated with the school that had rejected him, and the local net went wild over them. When offended nobles started sending investigators to find out who had mocked them, Duncan quickly enlisted, reasoning correctly that it was the best place to hide in plain sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn basic training, nobody cared about his cartoons as long as he did as ordered. They cared even less when he volunteered for anti-'Mech and insurgency training. Once again, he was in a place where hard work mattered, and soon he was assigned to SAFE, the Free Worlds League intelligence arm. They found his artistic skills and the keen perception that went with them quite useful. He did not, of course, make a name for himself, because his work was never signed, but even after he was injured and  transferred back home again, some of his cartoons were used as an unofficial currency among the members of the Analysis Branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remained on his home planet until it was attacked and annexed by the Capellan Confederation. After escaping the invasion with his family and seeing them resettled elsewhere in the Duchy, he made his way to Galatea to earn a living as a mercenary. He still draws his cartoons, still never signs them, but the junior pilots and crew who receive one after a blunder know exactly who they come from and, if they're smart, they treasure them.",

The only reason he survived his first day was due to the ancient BattleMech torso nearby where a decrepit old MechWarrior was enjoying his lunch. The old-timer saw the falling junk, fired up the 'Mech's lasers and blew it out of the sky. (This was, in fact, the old-timer's job, because stuff fell on Panzyr about every week around the time Einar was born.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pretty much set the tone for Einar's childhood. Something awful would happen to him as he was doing perfectly ordinary things like climbing on an overgrown spaceship wreck, and yet somehow, he'd survive. Barely. And then he'd get lectured on how he wasn't being careful enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Einar grew up to be very, very careful indeed. And, as soon as he could, he left Panzyr, before something happened to make it impossible rather than merely very difficult. He had the fond but relieved farewells of his entire township, who rather hoped some of Panzyr's bad luck would go with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it has, it's mostly been turned toward his enemies. He's a very competent MechWarrior, and well-liked among his peers. Nobody believes stories of his jinx, which is nice compared to back home.

It was, he freely admits, a weird childhood. He managed to develop a completely normal personality, with good metrics in every field that mattered and his parents are still patting themselves on the back about that twenty years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to a military academy on Coromodir 6, and after graduation pursued further schooling before joining the Royal Guard. There, he quickly became a popular lieutenant due to his mild personality, dependable nature and general patience. Unfortunately, in 3022, a new commanding officer made the mistake of assuming all those positive traits meant he would blindly obey illegal orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter incapacitating his commanding officer, he directed his command in the defense of House Arano until it was clear there was no immediate hope in that regard. He then saw to his command's safety before escaping off-world. Now, he works as a mercenary while monitoring the Aurigan situation, waiting for a chance to once again honor his oaths to House Arano.",

After young Erin broke a standardized aptitude testing program three times, their preschool counselor referred them to a planetside specialist. Erin's parent, who couldn't afford such things and felt that their child was just fine, declined at first to follow up. It wasn't until the counselor contacted the specialist and the specialist presented himself at Erin's parent's door that Erin's capabilities were properly evaluated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, Erin's childhood became a tug-of-war between their parent of uncommon sense and a bevy of interested other parties who wanted to stake an early claim to Erin's genius. It was impossible for Erin to be oblivious to this, but they adapted cheerfully to stressors that might have crushed another child. Erin's parent, who wanted above all to make sure their child grew up happy and healthy, refused to push their child in any particular direction. But when House Madeira got directly involved, it was impossible for Erin or their parent to resist. Erin's parent was granted a large honorarium and a dwelling planetside, and Erin themselves was fast-tracked into the most elite branch of the House Madeira Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then Espinoza's coup happened. Like so many dispossessed loyalists, Erin Sosa is now working as a Periphery mercenary. Their parent is somewhere safe for now, and someday, perhaps they'll both get to go home again.",

After Farida's mother was was compelled to return to her duties, Farida was raised exclusively by her father, who had settled down to run an arcade and general store that catered to hopeful prospectors. She grew up being trained on BattleMech simulators by her father, who incorporated the training into their lives so naturally that she never quite realized what an excellent MechWarrior and trainer he was. She despaired of his happy-go-lucky nature, but idolized her elder brother, who, like her, had inherited their mother's sober, responsible nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, due to events she never quite understood, her brother left Katinka while she was still a teen, taking her father's previously-hidden BattleMech with him. Though she wanted to follow him, that sense of responsibility kept her at her father's side. It wasn't until Espinoza's coup that her father revealed that he was perfectly capable of handling the store without her, and unleashed her on an unsuspecting Periphery.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe's spent her time since working as a mercenary, constantly striving to improve herself, constantly comparing herself to an impossible ideal. A quiet woman, more than one strutting braggart has underestimated her, sometimes to their sorrow. She never, ever argues with leadership decisions she disagrees with. If she decides a line has been crossed, she acts as she considers appropriate. She's left more than one angry mercenary commander behind.",

His family was part of group of slaves from a pirate planet who had escaped on a stolen ship and stumbled onto the Escape's verdant lushness. Unfortunately his own parents had both died from disease by the time he was ten years old, and he was taken in by a local orphanage run by a man who had picked up his moral code from pirates.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Garrat spent his teenage and young adult years picking pockets, casing houses, and fleecing the occasional visitors to the Escape who stopped to resupply. It wasn't his preferred life and he often dreamed of escape, but could never work out a way out of his situation\\u2026until one day he messed with the wrong mercenary company. Or, from a long term perspective, the right one. After being caught red-handed stealing from the company, the commander had him thrown into their DropShip's brig and, once he was off planet, demanded he repay what he stole through hard labor. He did so, and so cheerfully that he was soon simply one of the crew. When his term with that company was up, he was free to make his own way in the Periphery, with plenty of legitimate skills to keep himself fed.",

He was adopted from the ruins of his home by the commander of passing mercenary company. Seeing unusual potential in the boy, his proclivities were encouraged and indulged by his protector, right up until there was a mutiny and fourteen year old Matthew was abandoned once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spent two years working his way across the Periphery, keeping his tendency toward violence in check until he finally arrived at Solaris VII \\u2014the destination his mentor had been aiming him toward all along. There he found one of the least respected gladiatorial stables and promised them that if they put him in a 'Mech, he'd take them to the top. Such was the force of his personality that they did. He kept his word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he wasn't as showy as some of the champions, and he didn't have crowd-pleasing manners, excellence has its own charm, and savagery creates its own reputation. For fifteen years, he dominated one-on-one arenas, until eventually his stable had trouble finding opponents for him to fight. As part of a long-term strategy to set up an explosive comeback fight, Matthew's manager convinced him to take an extended sabbatical from the ring. Now, unable to relax unless he's fought something recently, Matthew is working as a mercenary in the Periphery. If baring his teeth counts as a smile, he smiles every time somebody recognizes his name.",

He grew up on the back stage of a traveling pleasure circus as part of an extended family responsible for the circus's pyrotechnic displays. While he shared his family's love for explosions, he quickly became bored with the limited creativity of the circus's well-defined show. As soon as he could talk his family into it, he and two of his cousins were traded to a new circus looking to start up its own pyrotechnics show in exchange for an apprentice dancer. The new circus focused on dramatic reenactments of historical battles\\u2014complete with BattleMech shells that required his expertise to look and sound real.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarely two years after joining his new circus, he started knocking at the doors of the Magistracy Armed Forces, hoping to join the Magistracy Royal Guard as a MechWarrior. Since his education up until that point had been very spotty, he was repeatedly turned away in favor of more traditional candidates. But the young Coldfire knew nothing could be better than piloting a 'Mech into battle, so he buckled down and learned just enough to pass the entry exams imposed by the MAF. They gave him the training he wanted, but not the battles. As soon as his contract expired, he abandoned the peace-loving Magistracy for a place where a MechWarrior could always find work: the unclaimed, lawless systems of the Rimward Periphery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a pilot, Coldfire is loud, jovial, and always up for the highest-risk missions\\u2014even if the likelihood of getting paid is low. Helping others is in his blood, he claims, and if he can have a good time while doing it, even better! He loves pushing the biggest 'Mechs to their highest speeds and relishes a well-executed Death From Above. Outside of battle, he's rambunctious but usually stops short of causing real trouble to his COs. And if you ever need a pyrotechnics display, he's your man.",

He grew up in a close and loving family, spending time with nature and animals. As he matured, he began to feel the pressures of the endless Third Succession War, and joined the military to defend his home and people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter enlistment and basic training, James was assigned to a ship's crew for his first tour. While serving as a crewman, he developed a reputation inspired by his quiet nature and firm manner that made him a shoo-in when the LCAF was looking to replenish its supply of special operatives. Shortly after starting service in spec ops, he fell in love with one of his support team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as his tour ended, he mustered out of the LCAF along with his new spouse, and the two of them settled down in the same place that he'd grown up. For all too short a time, he enjoyed a renewal of that close family life in a peaceful agricultural region. But then the war he'd thought he left behind found him once again. While traveling on farm business, his small town was caught in-between raiders and Lyran defenders. His entire family was wiped out.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames had kept in touch with all of his old military friends and contacts. He could have called on any of them. But it was too late for his family, too late for his faith in House Steiner, and probably too late for him. All he had left was revenge, and the only way he knew to get it was to join a mercenary company and keep his eyes sharp for justice.",

This was just a stepping stone to getting his own BattleMech, however. He earned assignment to a Griffin after several years writing up reports on other pilots and attending off-hours training sessions.  He was assigned to the Storm Company in the Lyran Guard, where he served faithfully for a five year tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when he was overlooked for a promotion due to his lack of family connections, he realized he had no interest in spending the rest of his life as nothing more than a 'Mech pilot for the military.

By the time he was an adult, they were a 'syndicate,' and he was running smuggling operations between cities, escorting the convoys in a BattleMech that had been 'adopted' just like him. Eventually, a long-term investigation fingered him, and the family matriarch shipped him off-planet to Solaris VII, to protect him as well as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Solaris VII, under instructions to create a new identity for himself, he settled into training to join a gladiatorial stable. While there, he dueled and defeated a spunky younger pilot who quickly decided he was her new mentor.

She spent her childhood being taught by retainers, while being instructed remotely by her father. On his rare return visits, he would test her. When she was fourteen, she won early admission to the Benjamin District Gymnasium.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before she could graduate from the Gymnasium, her father was arrested as a traitor and the family assets were seized by ISF. She learned this when a friend of her father's attempted to kidnap her from the school for her own protection. After verifying her prisoner's story, she decided to accompany him off-planet to that she might investigate and if needed, avenge her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer guardian had other plans. Soothing her with talk of a long game, Kyone and 'Uncle' Yosuke spent several years traveling from one system to the next, with less and less talk of returning to Shirotori. Eventually, having traveled enough to realize the futility of it, Kyone gave up talk of justice and revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, Yosuke's money ran out. Coincidentally, they happened to be on Solaris VII at that point. Bored with constant travel, Kyone chose not to dig below the surface of her guardian's request that she participate in gladiator fights to help with the bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe won early and often, and the financial pressures on her protector eased. But as her battles became more and more carefully arranged, and more and more risky, Yosuke's financial burdens grew again. And yet Kyone enjoyed herself\\u2026 until one bloodsoaked black night all her pleasure in the arena vanished forever. That was the night she discovered Yosuke, brutally murdered over secret debts he'd incurred supporting her all those years, and set out to punish those who had once again taken her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was then. Now... she's in the Periphery, alone, working as a mercenary MechWarrior. She doesn't talk much. And when she fights, she's very, very hard to stop.",

Her wealthy father was a 'Mech enthusiast who volunteered his own BattleMech for local militia use. From age 8 she rode with him in the cockpit, becoming an informal mascot for the militia. But as she grew, her role as mascot worked against her. She wanted to be taken seriously as a future leader of the militia, but despite their affection, her seniors gave her no credit for actual ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Llana tried to prove herself through enlistment. But her first deployment was more than she bargained for, and a part of her simply broke. During what she would later recall as the darkest time of her life, Llana joined other deserters from her unit on an interplanetary crime spree. It wasn't until her father personally tracked her down and confronted her that she started coming to terms with what she'd done and what she was willing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wanted to turn herself in to her original unit, but her father convinced her to come home again instead. She no longer had a legal identity in the Capellan Confederation, but her father's militia welcomed her anyhow. Once again she sat in the cockpit of a 'Mech, defending the home she loved \\u2014 all the way up until her father died. Then the lawyers came for her father's 'Mech, and her continued existence was discovered. Once again, she wanted to stay and face her fate, but the militia members who had watched her grow up couldn't bear it, and forced her to flee her home. Now she wanders the Periphery, taking mercenary jobs and hoping to one day put together her own company that she can lead back to the defense of New Hessen.",

While his parents and aunts worked on urban vehicles and passenger aircraft, they had a family love of BattleMechs, watching holovids of the Solaris games together and once enjoying a family trip to the legendary planet. In their spare time, they'd construct models together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time that Lorenzo was old enough to attend technical school, work as a MechTech was no longer an elite position for mechanics. Decades of war did that. When he graduated, he had his pick of positions, and chose to work on a DropShip so he could see other systems. After his first tour of duty was up, he realized that he could enjoy more freedom working for a mercenary company rather than the AFFS, and moved  Rimward. This allowed him more time to continue working on the models that had been a lifetime interest. He enjoyed trying to recreate the look of Lostech designs even if the technology itself was beyond him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming a pilot was never a driving interest of his, but when his current employer ended up in a situation where pilots were needed more than techs, he stepped up and discovered how easy it was for him to maneuver BattleMechs. Now he accepts work in either position, but has found, on average, he has more time to pursue his hobby if he works as a pilot.",

The second son of a second daughter, he grew up as indulged and arrogant as any young noble from a basically peaceful world. He was piloting 'Mechs as soon as he was big enough to wear a neurohelmet, playing at war with his cousins and participating in local tournaments. When he was of age, he joined the Itrom system security force as all nobles from his House traditionally did. He anticipated a glorious two years chasing pirates across lunar landscapes, and firmly planned to extend his military career as long as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, in his first year of service, his lance was ambushed and Octavio was so badly injured that his tour of duty ended immediately. Even though he was attended by the best doctors in the system, it took him over a year to recover full mobility. By the time he had, he'd found something more interesting to him than war games and tournaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was recovering, he was visited often by a more bookish cousin. When he was an up-and-coming MechWarrior, Octavio hadn't seen the appeal of reading for pleasure but after days of tedium and a few careful selections by his cousin, the young noble became a convert. Alas, he did not become <i>scholastic</i>, as some of his elders hoped. No, Octavio became an inveterate reader of fiction, of <i>novels</i>, and of the trashiest variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spent years reading genre classics he'd ignored as a child. He participated in book clubs, along with other aspects of society he'd previously scorned. He was, in general, a somewhat distracted but very well behaved noble scion. And then the war his younger self had dreamt of invaded his home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis was only a minor House, but everybody had to pick sides after Espinoza's coup. Octavio and most of his family were unquestionably on the <i>wrong</i> side, and leaving Itrom was their only option. In the wilds of the Periphery, they were no longer a noble family. They all needed to work for their dinner. Fortunately, Octavio's active youth left him with a marketable skill that never went out of style, and he found work as a mercenary 'Mech pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, he admits, more interesting than Society on Itrom. There are so <i>many</i> personalities all crammed together on a mercenary DropShip. It's giving him ideas. And one day soon, he's going to finish his own novel. It's sure to be a hit.",

He grew up learning almost all of the trades associated with spacefaring merchants, but was far better working with his hands than bartering with customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, he felt he had nothing to complain of as one of the younger members of a very large family. However, as the oldest generation began passing away, Risenki found himself being drawn into the more complicated squabbles of the new generation of leaders. He hadn't minded obeying the dictates of his grandparents and great-aunts. But his aunts and uncles would hand him responsibility and then countermand his instructions to his juniors, then berate him when things didn't turn out as they wished. This was simply not the life he wished to lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after much thought, he struck out on his own. He had some trouble finding work outside of the connections of his family, and at last washed up on Solaris VII. Here, he found there was always work in one of the gladiatorial stables. When they put him in a BattleMech, he further found they were far easier to pilot that he'd expected. However, he was not of a warrior mindset, and as soon as his contract with his stable was completed, they let him go.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe returned to wandering. However, he now had skills that were always in demand among the mercenary companies of the Periphery. While he could not shine in gladiatorial combat, he enjoys working as part of a mercenary lance. He gets instructions, and he works with his 'Mech to accomplish his task, and all is well. Well, for him. Not so much for those he steps on.",

'Apprenticed,' they called it. He does not say the name of the company, except to observe, with dark glee, that they no longer exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter escaping his original company as a young man, he continued to seek employment as a mercenary, first as ground support for BattleMech lances, and then as a BattleMech pilots. He has had many commanders, and does not always leave with good reports. Insubordination is a common complaint. It's not that he's rude. It's just that if he disapproves of a mission, or how it's being carried out, he will instead enact his own plan.

He spent most of his childhood barefoot, learning to climb and jump and instinctively calculate odd angles. When he was nearly grown, he was 'banished' to the starport for complaining too much about fishing. There, he saw his first BattleMech and was thoroughly unimpressed by how big and awkward they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the starport, his unique skills earned him unusual attention, and soon he was recruited by a mercenary company for a very particular form of covert operations. However, they neglected to properly indoctrinate him before unleashing him, and when the moment came for him to complete a particularly dishonorable assassination, he froze, fumbled, and fled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was years ago. He never returned to his original mercenary company, but there are plenty of others. While he initially disliked BattleMechs, he now finds solace in piloting one. It's a way of earning his keep that only reveals a face <i>still</i> on Wanted: dispatches to his mercenary teammates.",

When he was grown, he naturally went out questing to discover and nurture what remained of that lost civilization. Although he trained at the Warrior's Hall, and earned some distinction serving in the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, he realized that the conflicts of the Inner Sphere would never let him really extend himself and work toward building a new golden age. So he went to the Periphery, where he found plenty of opportunities to hone his skills while evaluating the noble potential of the nations there. He's a valued MechWarrior wherever he goes, as his honor and clear-thinking combine to make him a natural leader in crisis situations -- but he rarely stays with any company for more than a year or so before another adventure pulls him away.",

He promised himself a life of action.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, the Combine has a place for bored boys who want a more active lifestyle. He was quickly enrolled in a military school, and, according to his breeding and his aptitude scores, set on a technician track. He started out his adult career working on armored personnel carriers. But his impressive zeal studying BattleMech mechanisms \\u2014 along with several very fine haiku on the subject of myomer\\u2014 earned him a transfer to a MechTech division.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn't enough for Aaron, who had a childhood promise to himself to fulfill. He took the exams at every opportunity, and even though his written answers were perfect and his literary allusions divine, he was never allowed the chance to take the practical exam. His childhood aptitude scores and his father's position had fixed his fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was presented with the wife that had been chosen for him, it was too much. He fled the Combine, traded a family treasure for a forged history, and soon found himself piloting a mercenary company BattleMech for the first time.  It didn't fall over and he didn't die, and so he found a new life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that he's proved himself in a 'Mech, the story of his escape from the Combine is a funny tale to share over drinks. But the touch of the Dragon lingers, and, perhaps, just a little, he misses the family he left behind.",

Once he graduated, he went onto the position waiting for him at the Ministry of Ways and Means.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, five years into his ten year contract, he realized that if he spent any more time at a desk job there would be 'an unhappy Incident even Mother couldn't smooth over.' To forestall this, he manipulated his supervisor into terminating his contract. Then he promptly bought his way into a Davion-aligned mercenary company, where he enjoyed himself thoroughly until the Third Succession War ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen his unit was disbanded, he was still unready to settle down. He headed out to the Periphery where there was still plenty of mercenary work to be found. He stays in regular contact with his family, and will certainly return home again if there is ever a real need for him. Meanwhile, he continues to pursue the adventurous lifestyle.",

Aptitude testing there declared him to be a good fit for special ops, so when he graduated from the Academy, he gave it a try.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis superior officers found very little to complain about, but in the old fairytale parlance, Aidan himself found it 'too hot'. So on his next tour, he opted to join a regular unit, to see if he enjoyed the more relaxing pace of overt warfare more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found his special ops experience quite useful in commanding his unit, and once again, his commanding officers had nothing but praise for his performance. Alas for the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, he found it 'too cold'.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, in search of something that would get his blood pumping but not make his hair stand on end, he retired from military service and traveled to Solaris VII. He joined a stable, participated in some bouts, and found a new stage in an old story: 'too expensive.'\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, he works as a mercenary in the Periphery. It isn't the military career he dreamed of as a child, but for now, it's 'just right,' the perfect mix of excitement and downtime in an all-expenses-paid environment.",

After he graduated, he was offered a commission as a navigator, but turned it down to return to academia. He spent several years earning an advanced degree in military history, which gave him an uncomfortable familiarity with the slow decline of civilization in the face of constant warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a round of conscriptions started, he was ordered back to service, and placed in a BattleMech. He did his duty, but he was a little too aware of the big picture for his superiors' comfort. As soon as a potential peace loomed on the horizon, he was mustered out. To avoid a repeat conscription when war inevitably began again, he headed out to the Periphery, where he found work as a mercenary pilot to pay the bills while he worked on a book about the Third Succession War.",

While she quickly proved her worth as an exceptional 'Mech pilot, her taste for mischief could not be satisfied so easily. She began dabbling in the barracks black market. During her first tour of duty, she piloted her Jenner with distinction - and ran the odd illegal substance along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn her next tour, without any combat action, she started cozying up to the Yakuza. This, however, was not as much fun as she'd hoped, and soon she found herself looking for an escape from water that had gotten much too hot. With the aid of some Davion connections she'd made, she fled the Combine and headed straight to the Periphery. Now she hires herself out as a mercenary - and if she makes a little on the side moving things from here to there, well, it makes people happy. And isn't that what counts?",

While her father and brothers worked in the factory itself, her mother and aunts were pilots serving in defense of the factory, so naturally, Viona followed in their footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, while she was still in training, there was a particular brutal attack on Hesperus II by the Free Worlds League. While the LCAF successfully defended Defiance Industries, a large portion of Viona's family were casualties of the assault. As a result, out of respect for her family's long service, Viona was allowed to finish her training but refused a combat assignment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisappointed at not having a chance to put her training to the test, Viona chose to go to Solaris VII, where she found work in a stable and survived her first bout. Later, while training, she was defeated by a rough-edged older pilot from the Federated Suns. Fascinated by his gruff attitude, she immediately adopted him as her mentor. When he abruptly left Solaris VII, she tracked him down and then followed him out to the Periphery, which turned out to be an even more interesting place than Solaris VII. Now she works as a mercenary, staying in contact with both her mentor and her remaining family on Hesperus II, and thoroughly enjoying life. ",

He was one of many.

He did not question, for it was all he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an infantryman deployed in support of BattleMech units, he displayed an unusual tenacity that earned the personal attention of one of the senior 'Mech pilots. Over the course of the following decade, the bond between the young soldier and the elder pilot grew, and as the MechWarrior was transferred between assignments, he made sure to bring his favorite foot soldier with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn time, at his mentor's request, Zachary was removed from the front lines and made the MechWarrior's personal aide and technician. He learned a great deal in this time, absorbing not only his mentor's piloting wisdom, but his jaded attitude about life in the Draconis Combine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, one day, his mentor died. It wasn't even an honorable death in battle, but in his sleep. While the death was declared to be heart failure, cohort opinion turned against Zachary. When his celebrated mentor had lived, nobody had dared express their jealousy over his status, but now that he was gone, that jealousy became suspicion and then outright accusations of murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Zachary was trying to decide how to defend his honor and cope with his grief, he discovered a final message from his mentor ordering him to flee the Combine to find a new life.
